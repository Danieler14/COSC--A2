  <h1>Team Profile</h1>

  <h2>Cassie</h2>
  <p>I was originally born in Australia, but moved to Hawaii when I was five and lived there for 12 years. After highschool I moved back over to Australia and mostly worked full time in hospitality. Currently I now work in tech support, and in my free time I like to play video games, and spend time researching cool tech. My IT experience mainly revolves around the basic troubleshooting that I have learned while on the job, and apart from that I have not had much former IT experience. I became interested in IT after I began to play video games,  and my passion for IT has since grown working in the IT Industry.</p>

  <h2>Andrew</h2>
  <p>My name is Andrew and I was born here in Australia, but come from a mixed background – my father is Romanian and my mother is Filipino. I completed my schooling at Woorana Park Primary School, Waverley Christian College and studied at Monash Uni for a bit. I currently work as a tradie part-time doing rigging (steel construction). I first gained an interest in IT at a very young age when I used to play games on my PSP. Since then I’ve been fascinated with having powerful devices that can be used anywhere, resulting in my interest in developing and maintaining both apps and websites suitable for the everyday user. Some hobbies of mine include soccer, snowboarding, skateboarding and camping</p>

<h2>Compare and Contrast</h2>
  <<h3>Personality Compare and Contrast
  </h3>  <img src="compare.png" alt height="400px;"
    style="float:left;/* text-align; left;*/">
<p>Green: Assigned Personality
<br>
Orange: Challenging opposites
<br>
<br>
Challenging opposites are types of personalities with the most potential for personality clash and conflict. However these conflicting personality types also offer the most room for growth. Since those involved in a challenging opposite relationship tend to be the most different, one person’s strengths are another’s weakness and so on.
<br>
<br>
Our groups challenging opposites are
Rodrigo and Cameron
Cameron, Andrew and Rodrigo
Daniel, Andrew, and Rodrigo
<br>
<br>
These 3 challenging personality types are the
Mediator
Introverted, Intuitive, Perfectionistic, Diplomat
Campaigner
Extroverted, Openhearted, Open Minded, Creative and Perceptive
Virtuoso
Introverted, Observant, Thoughtful and Turbulent
<br>
<br>
In the group, the following members appear to be the most distinctly different in approach and extroverted/ introvertedness according to the Myer Briggs 16 Personalities test. However there are still some very strong similarities across all three challenging opposites. They all mention the idea of being Perceptive, Intuitive or Observant which are all very similar attributes as opposed to say one personality being described as inattentive.

<h2>How We Learn</h2>
    <img src="compare.png" alt height="400px;"
    style="float:left;/* text-align; left;*/">
<p>From the test results, a large proportion of our group are visual learners, I.e they learn by reading or seeing pictures. This means that statistically, the majority of our group will struggle with spoken direction as they are easily distracted by noise.
<br>
<br>
Considering this, it would be beneficial to meet in quiet places, not in libraries or cafeterias, and to either use a white board, share someone's screen if meeting online, or by turning on all video cameras to benefit the majority of the group.
<br>
<br>
Also creating a meeting notes list at the end so that the group may refer to it later would be ideal.

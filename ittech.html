<h2>Raspberry Pi's and Arduino's</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Project started in 2006 inspired by the success of the BBC Micro,an educational small computer using a microprocessor. This small powerhouse was created in the 1980’s and was a pivotal moment for personal-use computer history.

In 2012 the Raspberry Pi Project finally finished its prototype stage and sold its first line of computers for $30 a unit. Aimed towards young people to offer computers at a low cost, the Raspberry Pi Foundation became the fastest growing computing company to date, selling over a million units in its first year.
</p>

<p>The origin of the name ‘Raspberry Pi’ was originally coined to follow the trend of computer manufacturers naming products after fruits. However, this small computer’s name “Raspberry” was also hilariously chosen as a reference to the expression, ‘blowing a raspberry’. The “Pi” in Raspberry Pi references the python code needed to run the device.

The first Raspberry Pi included all the components needed to be able to operate as a normal computer. They include a CPU, RAM, USB Port, GPIO Pins and a HDMI slot. Nowadays, the more updated version also includes microHDMI LAN and an updated CPU of 4x 1.4Ghz, much like the regular personal computers we have today. The Raspberry Pi can do most things our desktops can, but with a more limited capacity. Due to this, Raspberry Pi’s have been used in place of normal desktops in locations where desktop PC’s might not be available or feasible.
</p>

<p> Due to the Raspberry Pi’s small stature however, along with its capability of a regular desktop computer, it can be used for other small projects. A Raspberry Pi is easily programmable, and allows its user to be able use the device to interact with the outside world. Thus, these small and cheap microprocessors can be used in a variety of projects such as lighting rigs, music machines, weather devices, and plant waterers. Because the Raspberry Pi reaches just 3 inches by 2 inches, it can be placed inconspicuously. </p>

<p> The Raspberry Pi’s primary language is Python. It comes pre-loaded into the machine, however it does also have the ability to run other computer languages as well.  One thing to take into consideration however, is if you choose to use Python 3 for your Raspberry Pi and you begin to write code in Python 2. This actually creates an incompatibility problem and your written code won't be able to run.

While most desktop computers run either Mac OS or Windows, the Raspberry Pi actually runs its own version of Linux called Raspbian. Raspbian is optimised for the Raspberry Pi and unlike other OS, comes with over 35,000 packages through a packet manager called “APT” or Advanced Packaging Tool which can be easily installed through the device itself. Many of these packages allow the user to install programs such as “Gimp” which is a powerful photoshop like program, “Fritzing” a program for drawing electronic circuits, and “Libreoffice”, an office suite containing programs such as Word and Spreadsheet. These packages allow for the many uses of the Raspberry Pi outside of just a standard computer OS.
 </p>

<p> Arduiono’s, unlike Raspberry Pi’s, are a less powerful tool that requires a separate PC to be able to program. While Raspberry Pi’s are completely self sufficient once plugged into a monitor and peripherals, Arduino’s are capable of being run on as little as a 9 volt battery and are a more popular choice for completing tasks that require simple task execution. Arduiono’s are more commonly used for smaller projects such as activating a motor, turning on an LED light or publishing something online. The user programs the Arduino through an existing computer and sends it a set of instructions for the Arduino to carry out. Unlike Raspberry Pi’s, Arduiono’s have the ability to run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The capabilities of an Arduino can be extended through the utilisation of libraries. Many libraries come installed with the Arduino but more can be downloaded externally to fit the user’s needs.</p>

<p> The incredible thing about Raspberry Pi’s and other microprocessors is that they are forever expanding and adapting to how we want to use them. The fact that the Raspberry Pi’s, Arduiono’s and other microprocessors already have the ability to be able to add components per a user’s requirements, make use of a wide range of programs at the touch of a download button. These microprocessors can perform to a high functioning standard already which show that the future of Raspberry Pi’s and self made, self tailored computing experiences are not a thing of the future. It can be foreseen that the ability to take off and add on components will mean that many can now afford to have a powerful computing device that fits an individual's needs, and that will continue to be advanced for more complex and demanding projects.
